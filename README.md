# Lunar-Image-Processing-Project
This project processes lunar images with advanced techniques, including noise reduction, enhancement, and the detection of Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR). The application features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy use, powered by PyQt5, and it allows for both image processing and metadata handling.
